About

This Blog

The content you’ll find on this site likely won’t be new or novel. I’ve simply found that writing down what I’ve learned and articulating my opinions on topics through writing is the most effective tool. I figure why not share with the broader community on the off chance that something could be meaningful.

Me

I’m an IoT architect with experience across consulting, high-growth organizations (through an IPO), and well-established manufacturers.

Motivated by working with systems that are or soon will operate at tremendous scale and that have a direct human impact.

Equally engaged by conversation around technical design, business objectives, or how to attract, grow, and retain the best talent.

Domains I’m passionate about:

Internet of Things (IoT)
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
Fleet Management / Over the Air Firmware Updates (OTA)
DevOps
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Serverless Architectures
API Development
Monitoring, Alerting, Logging, and other instrumentation systems
Favorite AWS Services

AWS Lambda
Amazon API Gateway
AWS IoT Core

A few of the principles I subscribe to:

- Extreme Ownership
- Iterate fast. Talk about the details after you’ve built v1.
- Always be learning
